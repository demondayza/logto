## Get started

The Line connector enables end-users to sign in to your application using their own Line accounts via the Line OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol.

## Setup a Line channel

Go to the [Line Developers](https://developers.line.biz/console/) and sign in with your Line business account. If you don’t have an account, you can register for one.

Then, go to [this link](https://developers.line.biz/console/register/line-login/provider/) to create a channel.

**Step 1:** Fill in the Channel Details.

Complete the form and create the channel.

**Step 2:** Setup callback URLs.

Go to channel details page and find "LINE login" tab and edit the "Callback URL" field.

In our case, this will be `${your_myeyesid_endpoint}/callback/${connector_id}`. e.g. `https://foo.myeyesid.app/callback/${connector_id}`. The `connector_id` can be found on the top bar of the MyEyesID Admin Console connector details page.

## Configure your connector

In your MyEyesID connector configuration, fill out the following fields with the values obtained from your App's "Auth" tab, "Application credentials" section:

- **clientId:** Your App's Channel ID.
- **clientSecret:** Your App's Channel Secret.

`scope` is a space-delimited list of OIDC scopes. If not provided, the default scope is `openid profile`.

### Config types

| Name         | Type   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| clientId     | string |
| clientSecret | string |
| scope        | string |
